### Personal data

Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "affected person"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

### Data when using the QuickImageComment program

If the program runs under Windows 10, error reports of program crashes and elementary anonymous usage data can be transmitted to the developer with the help of Microsoft AppCenter. The user must give his consent for this transmission when the program is started for the first time. If this consent is not given, no data is collected and transmitted. The consent can be revoked via mask "Settings".

**The following general data is transmitted (with examples):**

    "id": "2ebed716-d414-4229-811b-ce148f67cb72",  
      "name": "FormSettings",  
      "timestamp": "2020-11-22T13:07:25.5593608Z",  
      "sid": "d06fe55c-2ac7-42d5-a44a-2b5d0c0df325",  
      "device": {  
        "sdkName": "appcenter.winforms",  
        "sdkVersion": "3.4.3",  
        "model": "WH657AA-ABD p6310de",

        "osName": "WINDOWS",  
        "osVersion": "10.0.19041",  
        "osBuild": "10.0.19041.630",  
        "locale": "de-DE",

        "appVersion": "4.36-X86-Beta4",  
        "appBuild": "4.37.0.0",  
        "appNamespace": "QuickImageComment"  
      },

**The bug reports additionally include:**

- Error text  
    E.g.: "Object reference not set to an instance of an object."  
    The error text can contain file names.
- StackTrace

Each transmission of a bug report must be confirmed individually.

**Transmission of elementary anonymous usage data**

The transmission of elementary anonymous usage data includes a designation of an event in addition to the general data, but no further details. Logged events are:

- Start of the program
- Opening of a mask
- Exit of the program initiated
- Exit of the program completed (user configuration saved)

### Using Google Maps and Bing Maps

With this program it is possible to display maps from Google Maps or Bing Maps. This is then done as in a usual web browser (e.g., Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge) and the data privacy policies of Google Maps or Bing Maps apply.
